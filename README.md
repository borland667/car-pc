The idea is to get information from car devices, sensors, processing that information, load data to storage, remote access to car devices. As server we will use raspberry pi or something like one. 

Tasks are: 
----------
1.  Processing information from a video recorder.
2.  Streaming video to the Internet
3.  Remote start engine
4.  Geting location
5.  Controlling devices of the car by voice commands
6.  Controlling fuel consumption and mark up it on the map
